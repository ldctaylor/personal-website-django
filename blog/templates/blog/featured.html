        <p>I am a Python developer with a deep interest in cybersecurity, hoping to find a role in back end development/engineering, QA, or cybersecurity. I have extensive experience in business analysis, QA testing, and agile project delivery, and decided during COVID lockdowns to move in a more technical direction. I'm a graduate of the October 2023 She Codes cohort.</p>
        <p>I am building this site from scratch using the Django framework with Bootstrap 5. It is still under development.</p>
